Native ESXi driver for RPi 4's GPIO interface.

Allows controlling the pins of the Raspberry Pi 4's GPIO interface.

Still very much work-in-progress!

Branch main contains:
- the base GPIO hardware driver
- a Python library for interacting with the GPIO MMIO memory directly
- a Python utility for interacting with the GPIO interface
- a Python utility for interacting with the Pimoroni FanShim
